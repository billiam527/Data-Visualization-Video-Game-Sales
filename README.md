## Background

The dataset consists of an excel file.  The columns consist of the name of the game, the platform it was realeased on, the year of the release, the genre, the publisher, the sales from various regions and the global sales, ratings from critics and users,the developer, and the rating of the games.  The data contains 31 different consoles and 13 different genres.  These will be the main focus of our analysis.  The various sales recorded are North American sales, European sales, Japanese Sales, other and global sales.

2) Select one of the kernels that include visualizations, and you are interested in reproducing/learning. 
a. Since I don't have any python experience (aside from the intro to python class I am currently taking) I needed to select a very simple & very basic kernel.  The kernel I selected was "Iris Species-Python Data Visualizations by Ben Hammer." This had 570 votes and based on the comments it appeared it would be easy for someone with no programming experience to use.

The goals for this repository are:

Please follow the following for the second project:
1) Select a dataset of your own choice (simple, complicated, whatever your level of comfort is)
2) Chop the dataset using pandas to fit whatever visualization you have in mind.
3) Clean the dataset and drop missing values - if needed
4) Create two different types of visualization - minimum. Your choice, just make sure they are different kinds - (for example a bar chart and a pie, but not two pies).
5) You can have more visualizations if you want
6) Make sure your readme file is perfect!
7) Submit on github and kaggle (if using kaggle datasets), just github if you are using data from other sources like drivedata.org or other census data.
8) Get in touch with me about anything that is worrisome - we can do skype or speak on the phone. Any concern you may have, do not hesitate.
